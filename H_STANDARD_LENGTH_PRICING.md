# H Material Standard Length Pricing Implementation

## Overview
Added a new pricing rule specifically for H (Halar) material that applies a $300 surcharge when the probe length is not one of the standard lengths.

## Standard Lengths
The following lengths are considered standard for H material and have **no surcharge**:
- 10", 12", 18", 24", 36", 48", 60", 72", 84", 96"

## Non-Standard Lengths
Any length that is not in the standard list will have a **$300 surcharge** applied.

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
1. **`core/pricing_engine.py`** - Updated `_calculate_length_pricing()` method
2. **`database/db_manager.py`** - Updated `calculate_length_cost()` method

### Logic Changes
- **Before**: H material had a $300 surcharge only when length > 96"
- **After**: H material has a $300 surcharge when length is NOT in the standard list

### Code Changes

#### Pricing Engine (`core/pricing_engine.py`)
```python
# Special rule for H (Halar) material: $300 adder for non-standard lengths
if material_code == 'H':
    standard_lengths = [10, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96]
    if probe_length not in standard_lengths:
        surcharge = 300.0
        result['breakdown'].append(f"Non-Standard Length Surcharge (H material, {probe_length}\" not in standard lengths): ${surcharge:.2f}")

# Original nonstandard length surcharge for other materials
elif (material_info['nonstandard_length_surcharge'] > 0 and 
      probe_length > 96.0):  # Nonstandard threshold for most materials
    surcharge = material_info['nonstandard_length_surcharge']
    result['breakdown'].append(f"Nonstandard Length Surcharge (>96\"): ${surcharge:.2f}")
```

#### Database Manager (`database/db_manager.py`)
```python
# Special rule for H (Halar) material: $300 adder for non-standard lengths
if material_code == 'H':
    standard_lengths = [10, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96]
    if probe_length not in standard_lengths:
        surcharge = 300.0

# Original nonstandard length surcharge for other materials
elif (material_info['nonstandard_length_surcharge'] > 0 and 
      probe_length > 96.0):  # Standard threshold for most materials
    surcharge = material_info['nonstandard_length_surcharge']
```

## Business Impact

### Customer Impact
- **Standard lengths (10, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96)**: No change in pricing
- **Non-standard lengths**: +$300 additional cost
- **Other materials**: Unaffected by this rule

### Examples
- **H material at 24"**: No surcharge (standard length)
- **H material at 25"**: +$300 surcharge (non-standard length)
- **S material at 25"**: No surcharge (rule doesn't apply to S material)

## Testing Results

### Verification Tests
- ✅ **Standard lengths**: No surcharge applied
- ✅ **Non-standard lengths**: $300 surcharge applied
- ✅ **Other materials**: Unaffected by the rule
- ✅ **Complete pricing integration**: Surcharge included in total price
- ✅ **Breakdown display**: Clear explanation in pricing breakdown

### Test Cases Validated
1. **Standard length boundaries**: Exact standard lengths have no surcharge
2. **Non-standard lengths**: Various non-standard lengths get $300 surcharge
3. **Material specificity**: Only H material affected, others unchanged
4. **Integration**: Complete pricing calculations include correct surcharge
5. **Display**: Pricing breakdown shows clear explanation

## Validation

### Pricing Examples
- **LS2000-24V-H-24"**: $675.00 (no surcharge - standard length)
- **LS2000-24V-H-25"**: $1085.00 (includes $300 surcharge - non-standard length)
- **LS2000-24V-S-25"**: $785.00 (no surcharge - rule doesn't apply to S material)

### Database Consistency
- Both pricing engine and database manager return identical results
- Surcharge is properly calculated and included in total pricing
- Breakdown provides clear explanation of the surcharge

## Summary
The H material standard length pricing rule has been successfully implemented. The rule applies a $300 surcharge only to H (Halar) material when the probe length is not one of the 10 standard lengths. This provides clear pricing guidance for customers while maintaining existing pricing for standard configurations.
