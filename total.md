## ‚ùå **What Still Needs To Be Done**

### **1. Pricing Engine (HIGH PRIORITY)**
**Current State**: No pricing calculations

**What's Missing**:
- Base pricing from `product_models` table
- Material pricing adders from `materials` table
- Option pricing from `options` table
- Length-based pricing calculations from `length_pricing` table
- Spare parts pricing integration

**Expected Implementation**:
- Integrate with existing `pricing_engine.py`
- Add spare parts pricing calculations
- Volume discounts and customer-specific pricing

### **2. Enhanced Part Number Validation (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
**Current State**: Basic validation with warnings

**What's Missing**:
- Database-driven validation against actual product catalogs
- Compatibility checking using material/option compatibility tables
- Product family specific option validation
- Lead time and availability checking

### **3. Quote Management System (LOW PRIORITY)**
**Current State**: Single quote generation

**What's Missing**:
- Quote numbering and tracking using `quotes` table
- Customer database integration
- Quote history and revision management
- Quote status workflow

### **4. Advanced Features (FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS)**
**Current State**: Basic functionality working

**What Could Be Added**:
- Multi-line quotes with different part numbers and spare parts
- PDF export capability
- Email integration for quote delivery
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Integration with external systems

## üöÄ **Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)**

### **Step 1: Add Spare Parts to Advanced GUI (2-3 hours) - NEXT PRIORITY**
- Add spare parts tab/section to the new professional interface
- Implement spare parts search and selection in tabbed display
- Add spare parts to quote display and export functionality
- Test spare parts functionality in the advanced GUI system

### **Step 2: Implement Full Product Pricing Engine (1-2 hours)**
- Add complete pricing calculations to `part_parser.py`
- Integrate base pricing, material adders, and option pricing
- Test with various part number combinations
- Add pricing validation and error handling

### **Step 3: Enhanced Quote Output (1 hour)**
- Add comprehensive pricing information to Word document export
- Include detailed breakdowns and totals for products and spare parts
- Add company branding and contact information

## üìä **Current Project Status**
