# Teflon Insulator Pricing Rules Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of conditional pricing rules for Teflon insulator material price adders in the Babbitt Quote Generator system.

## Business Rules Implemented

### 1. Existing Rule (Halar Material)
- **Condition**: If probe material is Halar (H) AND insulator is Teflon (TEF)
- **Action**: No price adder is applied
- **Reason**: Halar-coated probes already include Teflon insulation as standard

### 2. New Rule (Base Insulator)
- **Condition**: If base insulator (default_insulator) is Teflon (TEF) AND insulator is Teflon (TEF)
- **Action**: No price adder is applied
- **Reason**: When the base configuration already includes Teflon as the default insulator, adding Teflon again should not incur an additional charge

## Models Affected by New Rule

The following models have Teflon (TEF) as their default insulator and will now have no price adder when Teflon insulator is selected:

- **FS10000**: Flow Switch
- **LS2100**: Loop Powered Level Switch
- **LS7000**: Level Switch
- **LS7000/2**: Dual Point Level Switch
- **LS8000**: Remote Mounted Level Switch
- **LS8000/2**: Remote Mounted Dual Point Switch
- **LT9000**: Level Transmitter

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

1. **`core/pricing_engine.py`**
   - Updated `_calculate_insulator_pricing()` method
   - Added `model_code` parameter to check base insulator
   - Added logic to check if `default_insulator` is TEF

2. **`database/db_manager.py`**
   - Updated `calculate_insulator_cost()` method
   - Added `model_code` parameter
   - Added logic to check base insulator rule

### Code Changes

#### Pricing Engine (`core/pricing_engine.py`)
```python
def _calculate_insulator_pricing(self, insulator_code: str, material_code: str, model_code: Optional[str] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # ... existing code ...
    
    # Special rule: If probe material is 'h', teflon insulation adder is not applied
    if material_code.upper() == 'H' and insulator_code.upper() == 'TEF':
        result['cost'] = 0.0
        result['breakdown'].append(f"Insulator ({insulator_info['name']}): $0.00 (Not applied - Material H)")
    # Special rule: If base insulator is Teflon, teflon insulation adder is not applied
    elif model_code and insulator_code.upper() == 'TEF':
        model_info = self.db.get_model_info(model_code)
        if model_info and model_info.get('default_insulator', '').upper() == 'TEF':
            result['cost'] = 0.0
            result['breakdown'].append(f"Insulator ({insulator_info['name']}): $0.00 (Not applied - Base insulator is Teflon)")
    elif cost > 0:
        result['cost'] = cost
        result['breakdown'].append(f"Insulator ({insulator_info['name']}): ${cost:.2f}")
```

#### Database Manager (`database/db_manager.py`)
```python
def calculate_insulator_cost(self, insulator_code: str, material_code: Optional[str] = None, model_code: Optional[str] = None) -> float:
    # ... existing code ...
    
    # Special rule: If probe material is 'h', teflon insulation adder is not applied
    if (material_code and material_code.upper() == 'H' and 
        insulator_code.upper() == 'TEF'):
        return 0.0
    
    # Special rule: If base insulator is Teflon, teflon insulation adder is not applied
    if (model_code and insulator_code.upper() == 'TEF'):
        model_info = self.get_model_info(model_code)
        if model_info and model_info.get('default_insulator', '').upper() == 'TEF':
            return 0.0
    
    return cost
```

## Testing

### Test Results
- ✅ Halar material with Teflon insulator: $0.00 (existing rule)
- ✅ Base insulator is Teflon with Teflon insulator: $0.00 (new rule)
- ✅ Normal pricing when no rules apply: $40.00 (standard pricing)
- ✅ Database manager methods work correctly
- ✅ Complete pricing integration works

### Test Coverage
- Individual pricing engine method testing
- Database manager method testing
- Complete pricing integration testing
- Multiple model configurations tested

## Impact

### Pricing Impact
- **Models with Teflon default insulator**: No additional cost when Teflon insulator is selected
- **Models with other default insulators**: Normal Teflon insulator pricing applies
- **Halar material**: Existing rule continues to apply (no Teflon adder)

### User Experience
- More accurate pricing for configurations where Teflon is already standard
- Clear breakdown messages explaining why no adder is applied
- Consistent behavior across all pricing methods

## Validation

The implementation has been tested and validated to ensure:
1. Existing functionality is preserved
2. New rule works correctly for all affected models
3. Normal pricing continues to work for unaffected configurations
4. Clear messaging in pricing breakdowns
5. Both pricing engine and database manager methods are consistent

## Future Considerations

- Monitor usage patterns to ensure the rule is working as expected
- Consider adding similar rules for other insulator materials if needed
- Maintain documentation of business rules for future reference
